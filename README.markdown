#### Notes

based on Bishoy Labibâ€™s version on [CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/28940/Cards-Game-Library), I make a large picture version base on the blogs [started something](http://www.istartedsomething.com/20061216/if-microsoft-were-a-casino/).

###### Warning

Silverlight is an out-dated technology by Microsoft and will be replace by WinRT/HTML5 soon, so I personaly suggest do not take too much time on Silverlight.
